# Comprehensive Prompt for Reimagining the University of Rwanda Student Portal

## Project Overview
Create a modern, user-centered digital ecosystem for the University of Rwanda that transforms how students interact with the university from application through graduation. The system should be built with scalability, accessibility, and innovation as core principles while addressing the specific needs of the Rwandan educational context.

## 1. Current System Analysis

### Primary Issues to Address:
- **Fragmented Digital Experience**: Students currently navigate multiple disconnected systems requiring separate logins and presenting inconsistent interfaces
- **Cumbersome Application Process**: The current admission application workflow has unnecessary complexity and redundant information requests
- **Limited Mobile Accessibility**: Poor experience on smartphones despite high mobile usage among Rwandan students
- **Performance Issues**: Slow loading times, especially during peak periods (registration, exam results)
- **Limited Self-Service Options**: Many processes still require in-person visits or manual processing
- **Information Architecture Problems**: Critical information is difficult to find or buried in complex navigation
- **Multilingual Limitations**: Insufficient support for Rwanda's official languages (Kinyarwanda, English, French)
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy systems with limited integration capabilities restricting innovation
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Current system lacks proper support for students with disabilities
- **Poor Communication Channels**: Notification systems are inconsistent and often missed by students
