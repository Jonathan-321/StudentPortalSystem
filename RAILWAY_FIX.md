# ðŸ”§ Railway Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Railway couldn't find `dist/index.js` because the build step wasn't running.

## The Solution
I've added the necessary configuration files to make Railway build your app correctly.

## Files Added/Modified:
1. **railway.json** - Railway configuration
2. **railway.toml** - Alternative config format 
3. **nixpacks.toml** - Build environment setup
4. **package.json** - Added `build:all` and `railway-build` scripts
5. **.env** - Basic environment variables

## Quick Redeploy Steps:

```bash
# 1. Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - add build configuration"
git push origin main

# 2. In Railway Dashboard:
# - Go to your project
# - Click "Redeploy" 
# OR use CLI:
railway up

# 3. Set environment variables in Railway:
railway variables set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

## What Railway Will Do Now:
1. Install all dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Build the client (`vite build`)
3. Build the server (`esbuild server/index.ts`)
4. Start the production server (`node dist/index.js`)

## Environment Variables (Railway auto-injects):
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically set by Railway when you add PostgreSQL
- `PORT` - Railway sets this automatically
- `SESSION_SECRET` - You need to set this manually (see step 3 above)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

## If It Still Fails:
Check the Railway logs for specific errors:
```bash
railway logs
```

Common issues:
- **Database connection**: Make sure PostgreSQL addon is attached
- **Port binding**: The app uses `process.env.PORT || 3000`
- **Build errors**: Check if all dependencies are in package.json

## Demo Accounts Work Immediately:
- Student: **john** / **password**  
- Admin: **admin** / **password**

The app auto-seeds the database on first run!
